** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()], [sqlite3_step()], and [sqlite3_finalize()],
** that allows an application to run multiple statements of SQL
** without having to use a lot of C code.
**
** ^The sqlite3_exec() interface runs zero or more UTF-8 encoded,
** semicolon-separate SQL statements passed into its 2nd argument,
** in the context of the [database connection] passed in as its 1st
** argument.  ^If the callback function of the 3rd argument to
** sqlite3_exec() is not NULL, then it is invoked for each result row
** coming out of the evaluated SQL statements.  ^The 4th argument to
** sqlite3_exec() is relayed through to the 1st argument of each
** callback invocation.  ^If the callback pointer to sqlite3_exec()
** is NULL, then no callback is ever invoked and result rows are
** ignored.
**
** ^If an error occurs while evaluating the SQL statements passed into
** sqlite3_exec(), then execution of the current statement stops and
** subsequent statements are skipped.  ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite3_exec()
** is not NULL then any error message is written into memory obtained
** from [sqlite3_malloc()] and passed back through the 5th parameter.
** To avoid memory leaks, the application should invoke [sqlite3_free()]
** on error message strings returned through the 5th parameter of
** sqlite3_exec() after the error message string is no longer needed.
** ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite3_exec() is not NULL and no errors
** occur, then sqlite3_exec() sets the pointer in its 5th parameter to
** NULL before returning.
**
** ^If an sqlite3_exec() callback returns non-zero, the sqlite3_exec()
** routine returns SQLITE_ABORT without invoking the callback again and
** without running any subsequent SQL statements.
**
** ^The 2nd argument to the sqlite3_exec() callback function is the
** number of columns in the result.  ^The 3rd argument to the sqlite3_exec()
** callback is an array of pointers to strings obtained as if from
** [sqlite3_column_text()], one for each column.  ^If an element of a
** result row is NULL then the corresponding string pointer for the
** sqlite3_exec() callback is a NULL pointer.  ^The 4th argument to the
** sqlite3_exec() callback is an array of pointers to strings where each
** entry represents the name of corresponding result column as obtained
** from [sqlite3_column_name()].
**
** ^If the 2nd parameter to sqlite3_exec() is a NULL pointer, a pointer
** to an empty string, or a pointer that contains only whitespace and/or
** SQL comments, then no SQL statements are evaluated and the database
** is not changed.
**

** <li> The application must not modify the SQL statement text passed into
**      the 2nd parameter of sqlite3_exec() while sqlite3_exec() is running.
** <li> The application must not dereference the arrays or string pointers
**       passed as the 3rd and 4th callback parameters after it returns.

/*
** CAPI3REF: OS Interface File Virtual Methods Object
**
** Every file opened by the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method populates an
** [sqlite3_file] object (or, more commonly, a subclass of the
** [sqlite3_file] object) with a pointer to an instance of this object.
** This object defines the methods used to perform various operations
** against the open file represented by the [sqlite3_file] object.
**
** If the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method sets the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
** to a non-NULL pointer, then the sqlite3_io_methods.xClose method
** may be invoked even if the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] reported that it failed.  The
** only way to prevent a call to xClose following a failed [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]
** is for the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] to set the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
** to NULL.
**
** The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
** [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
** The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.  The [SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY]
** flag may be ORed in to indicate that only the data of the file
** and not its inode needs to be synced.
**
** The integer values to xLock() and xUnlock() are one of
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE].
** </ul>
** xLock() upgrades the database file lock.  In other words, xLock() moves the
** database file lock in the direction NONE toward EXCLUSIVE. The argument to
** xLock() is always one of SHARED, RESERVED, PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE, never
** SQLITE_LOCK_NONE.  If the database file lock is already at or above the
** requested lock, then the call to xLock() is a no-op.
** xUnlock() downgrades the database file lock to either SHARED or NONE.
** If the lock is already at or below the requested lock state, then the call
** to xUnlock() is a no-op.
** The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection,
** either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED,
** PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns true
** if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
**
** The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
** VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
** [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second "op" argument is an
** integer opcode.  The third argument is a generic pointer intended to
** point to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
** write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
** functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
** locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
** about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
** core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.
** A [file control opcodes | list of opcodes] less than 100 is available.
** Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes
** greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.  VFS implementations should
** return [SQLITE_NOTFOUND] for file control opcodes that they do not
** recognize.
**
** The xSectorSize() method returns the sector size of the
** device that underlies the file.  The sector size is the
** minimum write that can be performed without disturbing
** other bytes in the file.  The xDeviceCharacteristics()
** method returns a bit vector describing behaviors of the
** underlying device:
**
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC512]

/*
** CAPI3REF: Standard File Control Opcodes
** KEYWORDS: {file control opcodes} {file control opcode}
**
** These integer constants are opcodes for the xFileControl method
** of the [sqlite3_io_methods] object and for the [sqlite3_file_control()]
** interface.
**
** <ul>
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE] opcode is used for debugging.  This
** opcode causes the xFileControl method to write the current state of
** the lock (one of [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE], [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED], [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE])
** into an integer that the pArg argument points to.
** This capability is only available if SQLite is compiled with [SQLITE_DEBUG].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT] opcode is used by SQLite to give the VFS
** layer a hint of how large the database file will grow to be during the
** current transaction.  This hint is not guaranteed to be accurate but it
** is often close.  The underlying VFS might choose to preallocate database
** file space based on this hint in order to help writes to the database
** file run faster.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_LIMIT]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_LIMIT] opcode is used by in-memory VFS that
** implements [sqlite3_deserialize()] to set an upper bound on the size
** of the in-memory database.  The argument is a pointer to a [sqlite3_int64].
** If the integer pointed to is negative, then it is filled in with the
** current limit.  Otherwise the limit is set to the larger of the value
** of the integer pointed to and the current database size.  The integer
** pointed to is set to the new limit.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE] opcode is used to request that the VFS
** extends and truncates the database file in chunks of a size specified
** by the user. The fourth argument to [sqlite3_file_control()] should
** point to an integer (type int) containing the new chunk-size to use
** for the nominated database. Allocating database file space in large
** chunks (say 1MB at a time), may reduce file-system fragmentation and
** improve performance on some systems.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER] opcode is used to obtain a pointer
** to the [sqlite3_file] object associated with a particular database
** connection.  See also [SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_JOURNAL_POINTER] opcode is used to obtain a pointer
** to the [sqlite3_file] object associated with the journal file (either
** the [rollback journal] or the [write-ahead log]) for a particular database
** connection.  See also [SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC_OMITTED]]
** No longer in use.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC] opcode is generated internally by SQLite and
** sent to the VFS immediately before the xSync method is invoked on a
** database file descriptor. Or, if the xSync method is not invoked
** because the user has configured SQLite with
** [PRAGMA synchronous | PRAGMA synchronous=OFF] it is invoked in place
** of the xSync method. In most cases, the pointer argument passed with
** this file-control is NULL. However, if the database file is being synced
** as part of a multi-database commit, the argument points to a nul-terminated
** string containing the transactions super-journal file name. VFSes that
** do not need this signal should silently ignore this opcode. Applications
** should not call [sqlite3_file_control()] with this opcode as doing so may
** disrupt the operation of the specialized VFSes that do require it.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_PHASETWO]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_PHASETWO] opcode is generated internally by SQLite
** and sent to the VFS after a transaction has been committed immediately
** but before the database is unlocked. VFSes that do not need this signal
** should silently ignore this opcode. Applications should not call
** [sqlite3_file_control()] with this opcode as doing so may disrupt the
** operation of the specialized VFSes that do require it.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_AV_RETRY]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_AV_RETRY] opcode is used to configure automatic
** retry counts and intervals for certain disk I/O operations for the
** windows [VFS] in order to provide robustness in the presence of
** anti-virus programs.  By default, the windows VFS will retry file read,
** file write, and file delete operations up to 10 times, with a delay
** of 25 milliseconds before the first retry and with the delay increasing
** by an additional 25 milliseconds with each subsequent retry.  This
** opcode allows these two values (10 retries and 25 milliseconds of delay)
** to be adjusted.  The values are changed for all database connections
** within the same process.  The argument is a pointer to an array of two
** integers where the first integer is the new retry count and the second
** integer is the delay.  If either integer is negative, then the setting
** is not changed but instead the prior value of that setting is written
** into the array entry, allowing the current retry settings to be
** interrogated.  The zDbName parameter is ignored.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL] opcode is used to set or query the
** persistent [WAL | Write Ahead Log] setting.  By default, the auxiliary
** write ahead log ([WAL file]) and shared memory
** files used for transaction control
** are automatically deleted when the latest connection to the database
** closes.  Setting persistent WAL mode causes those files to persist after
** close.  Persisting the files is useful when other processes that do not
** have write permission on the directory containing the database file want
** to read the database file, as the WAL and shared memory files must exist
** in order for the database to be readable.  The fourth parameter to
** [sqlite3_file_control()] for this opcode should be a pointer to an integer.
** That integer is 0 to disable persistent WAL mode or 1 to enable persistent
** WAL mode.  If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current
** WAL persistence setting.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE] opcode is used to set or query the
** persistent "powersafe-overwrite" or "PSOW" setting.  The PSOW setting
** determines the [SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE] bit of the
** xDeviceCharacteristics methods. The fourth parameter to
** [sqlite3_file_control()] for this opcode should be a pointer to an integer.
** That integer is 0 to disable zero-damage mode or 1 to enable zero-damage
** mode.  If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current
** zero-damage mode setting.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE] opcode is invoked by SQLite after opening
** a write transaction to indicate that, unless it is rolled back for some
** reason, the entire database file will be overwritten by the current
** transaction. This is used by VACUUM operations.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME] opcode can be used to obtain the names of
** all [VFSes] in the VFS stack.  The names are of all VFS shims and the
** final bottom-level VFS are written into memory obtained from
** [sqlite3_malloc()] and the result is stored in the char* variable
** that the fourth parameter of [sqlite3_file_control()] points to.
** The caller is responsible for freeing the memory when done.  As with
** all file-control actions, there is no guarantee that this will actually
** do anything.  Callers should initialize the char* variable to a NULL
** pointer in case this file-control is not implemented.  This file-control
** is intended for diagnostic use only.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_VFS_POINTER]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_VFS_POINTER] opcode finds a pointer to the top-level
** [VFSes] currently in use.  ^(The argument X in
** sqlite3_file_control(db,SQLITE_FCNTL_VFS_POINTER,X) must be
** of type "[sqlite3_vfs] **".  This opcodes will set *X
** to a pointer to the top-level VFS.)^
** ^When there are multiple VFS shims in the stack, this opcode finds the
** upper-most shim only.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]]
** ^Whenever a [PRAGMA] statement is parsed, an [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control is sent to the open [sqlite3_file] object corresponding
** to the database file to which the pragma statement refers. ^The argument
** to the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control is an array of
** pointers to strings (char**) in which the second element of the array
** is the name of the pragma and the third element is the argument to the
** pragma or NULL if the pragma has no argument.  ^The handler for an
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control can optionally make the first element
** of the char** argument point to a string obtained from [sqlite3_mprintf()]
** or the equivalent and that string will become the result of the pragma or
** the error message if the pragma fails. ^If the
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control returns [SQLITE_NOTFOUND], then normal
** [PRAGMA] processing continues.  ^If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control returns [SQLITE_OK], then the parser assumes that the
** VFS has handled the PRAGMA itself and the parser generates a no-op
** prepared statement if result string is NULL, or that returns a copy
** of the result string if the string is non-NULL.
** ^If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control returns
** any result code other than [SQLITE_OK] or [SQLITE_NOTFOUND], that means
** that the VFS encountered an error while handling the [PRAGMA] and the
** compilation of the PRAGMA fails with an error.  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control occurs at the beginning of pragma statement analysis and so
** it is able to override built-in [PRAGMA] statements.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER]
** file-control may be invoked by SQLite on the database file handle
** shortly after it is opened in order to provide a custom VFS with access
** to the connection's busy-handler callback. The argument is of type (void**)
** - an array of two (void *) values. The first (void *) actually points
** to a function of type (int (*)(void *)). In order to invoke the connection's
** busy-handler, this function should be invoked with the second (void *) in
** the array as the only argument. If it returns non-zero, then the operation
** should be retried. If it returns zero, the custom VFS should abandon the
** current operation.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_TEMPFILENAME]]
** ^Applications can invoke the [SQLITE_FCNTL_TEMPFILENAME] file-control
** to have SQLite generate a
** temporary filename using the same algorithm that is followed to generate
** temporary filenames for TEMP tables and other internal uses.  The
** argument should be a char** which will be filled with the filename
** written into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].  The caller should
** invoke [sqlite3_free()] on the result to avoid a memory leak.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_MMAP_SIZE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_MMAP_SIZE] file control is used to query or set the
** maximum number of bytes that will be used for memory-mapped I/O.
** The argument is a pointer to a value of type sqlite3_int64 that
** is an advisory maximum number of bytes in the file to memory map.  The
** pointer is overwritten with the old value.  The limit is not changed if
** the value originally pointed to is negative, and so the current limit
** can be queried by passing in a pointer to a negative number.  This
** file-control is used internally to implement [PRAGMA mmap_size].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_TRACE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_TRACE] file control provides advisory information
** to the VFS about what the higher layers of the SQLite stack are doing.
** This file control is used by some VFS activity tracing [shims].
** The argument is a zero-terminated string.  Higher layers in the
** SQLite stack may generate instances of this file control if
** the [SQLITE_USE_FCNTL_TRACE] compile-time option is enabled.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_HAS_MOVED]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_HAS_MOVED] file control interprets its argument as a
** pointer to an integer and it writes a boolean into that integer depending
** on whether or not the file has been renamed, moved, or deleted since it
** was first opened.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_GET_HANDLE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_GET_HANDLE] opcode can be used to obtain the
** underlying native file handle associated with a file handle.  This file
** control interprets its argument as a pointer to a native file handle and
** writes the resulting value there.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_SET_HANDLE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_SET_HANDLE] opcode is used for debugging.  This
** opcode causes the xFileControl method to swap the file handle with the one
** pointed to by the pArg argument.  This capability is used during testing
** and only needs to be supported when SQLITE_TEST is defined.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WAL_BLOCK]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WAL_BLOCK] is a signal to the VFS layer that it might
** be advantageous to block on the next WAL lock if the lock is not immediately
** available.  The WAL subsystem issues this signal during rare
** circumstances in order to fix a problem with priority inversion.
** Applications should <em>not</em> use this file-control.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_ZIPVFS]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_ZIPVFS] opcode is implemented by zipvfs only. All other
** VFS should return SQLITE_NOTFOUND for this opcode.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_RBU]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_RBU] opcode is implemented by the special VFS used by
** the RBU extension only.  All other VFS should return SQLITE_NOTFOUND for
** this opcode.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE]]
** If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE] opcode returns SQLITE_OK, then
** the file descriptor is placed in "batch write mode", which
** means all subsequent write operations will be deferred and done
** atomically at the next [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE].  Systems
** that do not support batch atomic writes will return SQLITE_NOTFOUND.
** ^Following a successful SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE and prior to
** the closing [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE] or
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_ROLLBACK_ATOMIC_WRITE], SQLite will make
** no VFS interface calls on the same [sqlite3_file] file descriptor
** except for calls to the xWrite method and the xFileControl method
** with [SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE] opcode causes all write
** operations since the previous successful call to
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE] to be performed atomically.
** This file control returns [SQLITE_OK] if and only if the writes were
** all performed successfully and have been committed to persistent storage.
** ^Regardless of whether or not it is successful, this file control takes
** the file descriptor out of batch write mode so that all subsequent
** write operations are independent.
** ^SQLite will never invoke SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE without
** a prior successful call to [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_ROLLBACK_ATOMIC_WRITE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_ROLLBACK_ATOMIC_WRITE] opcode causes all write
** operations since the previous successful call to
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE] to be rolled back.
** ^This file control takes the file descriptor out of batch write mode
** so that all subsequent write operations are independent.
** ^SQLite will never invoke SQLITE_FCNTL_ROLLBACK_ATOMIC_WRITE without
** a prior successful call to [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCK_TIMEOUT]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCK_TIMEOUT] opcode is used to configure a VFS
** to block for up to M milliseconds before failing when attempting to
** obtain a file lock using the xLock or xShmLock methods of the VFS.
** The parameter is a pointer to a 32-bit signed integer that contains
** the value that M is to be set to. Before returning, the 32-bit signed
** integer is overwritten with the previous value of M.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_DATA_VERSION]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_DATA_VERSION] opcode is used to detect changes to
** a database file.  The argument is a pointer to a 32-bit unsigned integer.
** The "data version" for the pager is written into the pointer.  The
** "data version" changes whenever any change occurs to the corresponding
** database file, either through SQL statements on the same database
** connection or through transactions committed by separate database
** connections possibly in other processes. The [sqlite3_total_changes()]
** interface can be used to find if any database on the connection has changed,
** but that interface responds to changes on TEMP as well as MAIN and does
** not provide a mechanism to detect changes to MAIN only.  Also, the
** [sqlite3_total_changes()] interface responds to internal changes only and
** omits changes made by other database connections.  The
** [PRAGMA data_version] command provides a mechanism to detect changes to
** a single attached database that occur due to other database connections,
** but omits changes implemented by the database connection on which it is
** called.  This file control is the only mechanism to detect changes that
** happen either internally or externally and that are associated with
** a particular attached database.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CKPT_START]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CKPT_START] opcode is invoked from within a checkpoint
** in wal mode before the client starts to copy pages from the wal
** file to the database file.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CKPT_DONE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CKPT_DONE] opcode is invoked from within a checkpoint
** in wal mode after the client has finished copying pages from the wal
** file to the database file, but before the *-shm file is updated to
** record the fact that the pages have been checkpointed.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_EXTERNAL_READER]]
** The EXPERIMENTAL [SQLITE_FCNTL_EXTERNAL_READER] opcode is used to detect
** whether or not there is a database client in another process with a wal-mode
** transaction open on the database or not. It is only available on unix.The
** (void*) argument passed with this file-control should be a pointer to a
** value of type (int). The integer value is set to 1 if the database is a wal
** mode database and there exists at least one client in another process that
** currently has an SQL transaction open on the database. It is set to 0 if
** the database is not a wal-mode db, or if there is no such connection in any
** other process. This opcode cannot be used to detect transactions opened
** by clients within the current process, only within other processes.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CKSM_FILE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CKSM_FILE] opcode is for use internally by the
** [checksum VFS shim] only.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_RESET_CACHE]]
** If there is currently no transaction open on the database, and the
** database is not a temp db, then the [SQLITE_FCNTL_RESET_CACHE] file-control
** purges the contents of the in-memory page cache. If there is an open
** transaction, or if the db is a temp-db, this opcode is a no-op, not an error.
** </ul>

typedef const char *sqlite3_filename;

/*
** CAPI3REF: OS Interface Object
**
** An instance of the sqlite3_vfs object defines the interface between
** the SQLite core and the underlying operating system.  The "vfs"
** in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".  See
** the [VFS | VFS documentation] for further information.
**
** The VFS interface is sometimes extended by adding new methods onto
** the end.  Each time such an extension occurs, the iVersion field
** is incremented.  The iVersion value started out as 1 in
** SQLite [version 3.5.0] on [dateof:3.5.0], then increased to 2
** with SQLite [version 3.7.0] on [dateof:3.7.0], and then increased
** to 3 with SQLite [version 3.7.6] on [dateof:3.7.6].  Additional fields
** may be appended to the sqlite3_vfs object and the iVersion value
** may increase again in future versions of SQLite.
** Note that due to an oversight, the structure
** of the sqlite3_vfs object changed in the transition from
** SQLite [version 3.5.9] to [version 3.6.0] on [dateof:3.6.0]
** and yet the iVersion field was not increased.
**
** The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
** structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
** a pathname in this VFS.
**
** Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
** the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
** and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
** in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
** searches the list.  Neither the application code nor the VFS
** implementation should use the pNext pointer.
**
** The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs
** structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
** or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
** The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
** object once the object has been registered.
**
** The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
** be unique across all VFS modules.
**
** [[sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]]
** ^SQLite guarantees that the zFilename parameter to xOpen
** is either a NULL pointer or string obtained
** from xFullPathname() with an optional suffix added.
** ^If a suffix is added to the zFilename parameter, it will
** consist of a single "-" character followed by no more than
** 11 alphanumeric and/or "-" characters.
** ^SQLite further guarantees that
** the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
** called. Because of the previous sentence,
** the [sqlite3_file] can safely store a pointer to the
** filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
** If the zFilename parameter to xOpen is a NULL pointer then xOpen
** must invent its own temporary name for the file.  ^Whenever the
** xFilename parameter is NULL it will also be the case that the
** flags parameter will include [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE].
**
** The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
** the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
** or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
** [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE].
** If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
** include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be set.
**
** ^(SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
** call, depending on the object being opened:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TRANSIENT_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUPER_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_WAL]
** </ul>)^
**
** The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
** change the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
** that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
** the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
** also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return
** SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
** file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random
** order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
**
** SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:
**
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
** </ul>
**
** The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
** deleted when it is closed.  ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** will be set for TEMP databases and their journals, transient
** databases, and subjournals.
**
** ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag is always used in conjunction
** with the [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE] flag, which are both directly
** analogous to the O_EXCL and O_CREAT flags of the POSIX open()
** API.  The SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE flag, when paired with the
** SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE, is used to indicate that file should always
** be created, and that it is an error if it already exists.
** It is <i>not</i> used to indicate the file should be opened
** for exclusive access.
**
** ^At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite
** to hold the [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third
** argument to xOpen.  The xOpen method does not have to
** allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.  Note that
** the xOpen method must set the sqlite3_file.pMethods to either
** a valid [sqlite3_io_methods] object or to NULL.  xOpen must do
** this even if the open fails.  SQLite expects that the sqlite3_file.pMethods
** element will be valid after xOpen returns regardless of the success
** or failure of the xOpen call.
**
** [[sqlite3_vfs.xAccess]]
** ^The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS]
** to test for the existence of a file, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to
** test whether a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
** to test whether a file is at least readable.  The SQLITE_ACCESS_READ
** flag is never actually used and is not implemented in the built-in
** VFSes of SQLite.  The file is named by the second argument and can be a
** directory. The xAccess method returns [SQLITE_OK] on success or some
** non-zero error code if there is an I/O error or if the name of
** the file given in the second argument is illegal.  If SQLITE_OK
** is returned, then non-zero or zero is written into *pResOut to indicate
** whether or not the file is accessible.
**
** ^SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for the
** output buffer xFullPathname.  The exact size of the output buffer
** is also passed as a parameter to both  methods. If the output buffer
** is not large enough, [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] should be returned. Since this is
** handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor
** to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
**
** The xRandomness(), xSleep(), xCurrentTime(), and xCurrentTimeInt64()
** interfaces are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
** included in the VFS structure for completeness.
** The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
** of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
** the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.
** The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
** least the number of microseconds given.  ^The xCurrentTime()
** method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and time as
** a floating point value.
** ^The xCurrentTimeInt64() method returns, as an integer, the Julian
** Day Number multiplied by 86400000 (the number of milliseconds in
** a 24-hour day).
** ^SQLite will use the xCurrentTimeInt64() method to get the current
** date and time if that method is available (if iVersion is 2 or
** greater and the function pointer is not NULL) and will fall back
** to xCurrentTime() if xCurrentTimeInt64() is unavailable.
**
** ^The xSetSystemCall(), xGetSystemCall(), and xNestSystemCall() interfaces
** are not used by the SQLite core.  These optional interfaces are provided
** by some VFSes to facilitate testing of the VFS code. By overriding
** system calls with functions under its control, a test program can
** simulate faults and error conditions that would otherwise be difficult
** or impossible to induce.  The set of system calls that can be overridden
** varies from one VFS to another, and from one version of the same VFS to the
** next.  Applications that use these interfaces must be prepared for any
** or all of these interfaces to be NULL or for their behavior to change
** from one release to the next.  Applications must not attempt to access
** any of these methods if the iVersion of the VFS is less than 3.

** CAPI3REF: Initialize The SQLite Library
**
** ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine initializes the
** SQLite library.  ^The sqlite3_shutdown() routine
** deallocates any resources that were allocated by sqlite3_initialize().
** These routines are designed to aid in process initialization and
** shutdown on embedded systems.  Workstation applications using
** SQLite normally do not need to invoke either of these routines.
**
** A call to sqlite3_initialize() is an "effective" call if it is
** the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked during the lifetime of
** the process, or if it is the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked
** following a call to sqlite3_shutdown().  ^(Only an effective call
** of sqlite3_initialize() does any initialization.  All other calls
** are harmless no-ops.)^
**
** A call to sqlite3_shutdown() is an "effective" call if it is the first
** call to sqlite3_shutdown() since the last sqlite3_initialize().  ^(Only
** an effective call to sqlite3_shutdown() does any deinitialization.
** All other valid calls to sqlite3_shutdown() are harmless no-ops.)^
**
** The sqlite3_initialize() interface is threadsafe, but sqlite3_shutdown()
** is not.  The sqlite3_shutdown() interface must only be called from a
** single thread.  All open [database connections] must be closed and all
** other SQLite resources must be deallocated prior to invoking
** sqlite3_shutdown().
**
** Among other things, ^sqlite3_initialize() will invoke
** sqlite3_os_init().  Similarly, ^sqlite3_shutdown()
** will invoke sqlite3_os_end().
**
** ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine returns [SQLITE_OK] on success.
** ^If for some reason, sqlite3_initialize() is unable to initialize
** the library (perhaps it is unable to allocate a needed resource such
** as a mutex) it returns an [error code] other than [SQLITE_OK].
**
** ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine is called internally by many other
** SQLite interfaces so that an application usually does not need to
** invoke sqlite3_initialize() directly.  For example, [sqlite3_open()]
** calls sqlite3_initialize() so the SQLite library will be automatically
** initialized when [sqlite3_open()] is called if it has not be initialized
** already.  ^However, if SQLite is compiled with the [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT]
** compile-time option, then the automatic calls to sqlite3_initialize()
** are omitted and the application must call sqlite3_initialize() directly
** prior to using any other SQLite interface.  For maximum portability,
** it is recommended that applications always invoke sqlite3_initialize()
** directly prior to using any other SQLite interface.  Future releases
** of SQLite may require this.  In other words, the behavior exhibited
** when SQLite is compiled with [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT] might become the
** default behavior in some future release of SQLite.
**
** The sqlite3_os_init() routine does operating-system specific
** initialization of the SQLite library.  The sqlite3_os_end()
** routine undoes the effect of sqlite3_os_init().  Typical tasks
** performed by these routines include allocation or deallocation
** of static resources, initialization of global variables,
** setting up a default [sqlite3_vfs] module, or setting up
** a default configuration using [sqlite3_config()].
**
** The application should never invoke either sqlite3_os_init()
** or sqlite3_os_end() directly.  The application should only invoke
** sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_shutdown().  The sqlite3_os_init()
** interface is called automatically by sqlite3_initialize() and
** sqlite3_os_end() is called by sqlite3_shutdown().  Appropriate
** implementations for sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end()
** are built into SQLite when it is compiled for Unix, Windows, or OS/2.
** When [custom builds | built for other platforms]
** (using the [SQLITE_OS_OTHER=1] compile-time
** option) the application must supply a suitable implementation for
** sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end().  An application-supplied
** implementation of sqlite3_os_init() or sqlite3_os_end()
** must return [SQLITE_OK] on success and some other [error code] upon

** This object is used in only one place in the SQLite interface.
** A pointer to an instance of this object is the argument to
** [sqlite3_config()] when the configuration option is
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC] or [SQLITE_CONFIG_GETMALLOC].
** By creating an instance of this object
** and passing it to [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC])
** during configuration, an application can specify an alternative
** memory allocation subsystem for SQLite to use for all of its
** dynamic memory needs.
**
** Note that SQLite comes with several [built-in memory allocators]
** that are perfectly adequate for the overwhelming majority of applications
** and that this object is only useful to a tiny minority of applications
** with specialized memory allocation requirements.  This object is
** also used during testing of SQLite in order to specify an alternative
** memory allocator that simulates memory out-of-memory conditions in
** order to verify that SQLite recovers gracefully from such
** conditions.
**
** The xMalloc, xRealloc, and xFree methods must work like the
** malloc(), realloc() and free() functions from the standard C library.
** ^SQLite guarantees that the second argument to
** xRealloc is always a value returned by a prior call to xRoundup.
**
** xSize should return the allocated size of a memory allocation
** previously obtained from xMalloc or xRealloc.  The allocated size
** is always at least as big as the requested size but may be larger.
**
** The xRoundup method returns what would be the allocated size of
** a memory allocation given a particular requested size.  Most memory
** allocators round up memory allocations at least to the next multiple
** of 8.  Some allocators round up to a larger multiple or to a power of 2.
** Every memory allocation request coming in through [sqlite3_malloc()]
** or [sqlite3_realloc()] first calls xRoundup.  If xRoundup returns 0,
** that causes the corresponding memory allocation to fail.
**
** The xInit method initializes the memory allocator.  For example,
** it might allocate any required mutexes or initialize internal data
** structures.  The xShutdown method is invoked (indirectly) by
** [sqlite3_shutdown()] and should deallocate any resources acquired
** by xInit.  The pAppData pointer is used as the only parameter to
** xInit and xShutdown.
**
** SQLite holds the [SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MAIN] mutex when it invokes
** the xInit method, so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  The
** xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite3_shutdown()] so it does
** not need to be threadsafe either.  For all other methods, SQLite
** holds the [SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM] mutex as long as the
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] configuration option is turned on (which
** it is by default) and so the methods are automatically serialized.
** However, if [SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] is disabled, then the other
** methods must be threadsafe or else make their own arrangements for
** serialization.
**
** SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
** call to xShutdown().

** METHOD: sqlite3
**

** has a unique 64-bit signed
** integer key called the [ROWID | "rowid"]. ^The rowid is always available
** as an undeclared column named ROWID, OID, or _ROWID_ as long as those
** names are not also used by explicitly declared columns. ^If
** the table has a column of type [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY] then that column
** is another alias for the rowid.
**
** ^The sqlite3_last_insert_rowid(D) interface usually returns the [rowid] of
** the most recent successful [INSERT] into a rowid table or [virtual table]
** on database connection D. ^Inserts into [WITHOUT ROWID] tables are not
** recorded. ^If no successful [INSERT]s into rowid tables have ever occurred
** on the database connection D, then sqlite3_last_insert_rowid(D) returns
** zero.
**
** As well as being set automatically as rows are inserted into database
** tables, the value returned by this function may be set explicitly by
** [sqlite3_set_last_insert_rowid()]
**
** Some virtual table implementations may INSERT rows into rowid tables as
** part of committing a transaction (e.g. to flush data accumulated in memory
** to disk). In this case subsequent calls to this function return the rowid
** associated with these internal INSERT operations, which leads to
** unintuitive results. Virtual table implementations that do write to rowid
** tables in this way can avoid this problem by restoring the original
** rowid value using [sqlite3_set_last_insert_rowid()] before returning
** control to the user.
**
** ^(If an [INSERT] occurs within a trigger then this routine will
** return the [rowid] of the inserted row as long as the trigger is
** running. Once the trigger program ends, the value returned
** by this routine reverts to what it was before the trigger was fired.)^
**
** ^An [INSERT] that fails due to a constraint violation is not a
** successful [INSERT] and does not change the value returned by this
** routine.  ^Thus INSERT OR FAIL, INSERT OR IGNORE, INSERT OR ROLLBACK,
** and INSERT OR ABORT make no changes to the return value of this
** routine when their insertion fails.  ^(When INSERT OR REPLACE
** encounters a constraint violation, it does not fail.  The

** the constraint problem so INSERT OR REPLACE will always change
** the return value of this interface.)^
**
** ^For the purposes of this routine, an [INSERT] is considered to
** be successful even if it is subsequently rolled back.
**
** This function is accessible to SQL statements via the
** [last_insert_rowid() SQL function].
**
** If a separate thread performs a new [INSERT] on the same

** or process has the table locked.
** The sqlite3_busy_handler() interface is used to implement
** [sqlite3_busy_timeout()] and [PRAGMA busy_timeout].
**
** ^If the busy callback is NULL, then [SQLITE_BUSY]
** is returned immediately upon encountering the lock.  ^If the busy callback
** is not NULL, then the callback might be invoked with two arguments.
**
** ^The first argument to the busy handler is a copy of the void* pointer which

** access the database and [SQLITE_BUSY] is returned
** to the application.
** ^If the callback returns non-zero, then another attempt
** is made to access the database and the cycle repeats.
**

/*
** CAPI3REF: Convenience Routines For Running Queries
** METHOD: sqlite3
**
** This is a legacy interface that is preserved for backwards compatibility.
** Use of this interface is not recommended.
**
** Definition: A <b>result table</b> is memory data structure created by the
** [sqlite3_get_table()] interface.  A result table records the
** complete query results from one or more queries.
**
** The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns.  But
** these numbers are not part of the result table itself.  These
** numbers are obtained separately.  Let N be the number of rows
** and M be the number of columns.
**
** A result table is an array of pointers to zero-terminated UTF-8 strings.
** There are (N+1)*M elements in the array.  The first M pointers point
** to zero-terminated strings that  contain the names of the columns.
** The remaining entries all point to query results.  NULL values result
** in NULL pointers.  All other values are in their UTF-8 zero-terminated
** string representation as returned by [sqlite3_column_text()].
**
** A result table might consist of one or more memory allocations.
** It is not safe to pass a result table directly to [sqlite3_free()].
** A result table should be deallocated using [sqlite3_free_table()].
**
** ^(As an example of the result table format, suppose a query result
** is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        Name        | Age
**        -----------------------
**        Alice       | 43
**        Bob         | 28
**        Cindy       | 21
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** There are two columns (M==2) and three rows (N==3).  Thus the
** result table has 8 entries.  Suppose the result table is stored
** in an array named azResult.  Then azResult holds this content:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        azResult&#91;0] = "Name";
**        azResult&#91;1] = "Age";
**        azResult&#91;2] = "Alice";
**        azResult&#91;3] = "43";
**        azResult&#91;4] = "Bob";
**        azResult&#91;5] = "28";
**        azResult&#91;6] = "Cindy";
**        azResult&#91;7] = "21";
** </pre></blockquote>)^
**
** ^The sqlite3_get_table() function evaluates one or more
** semicolon-separated SQL statements in the zero-terminated UTF-8
** string of its 2nd parameter and returns a result table to the
** pointer given in its 3rd parameter.
**
** After the application has finished with the result from sqlite3_get_table(),
** it must pass the result table pointer to sqlite3_free_table() in order to
** release the memory that was malloced.  Because of the way the
** [sqlite3_malloc()] happens within sqlite3_get_table(), the calling
** function must not try to call [sqlite3_free()] directly.  Only
** [sqlite3_free_table()] is able to release the memory properly and safely.
**
** The sqlite3_get_table() interface is implemented as a wrapper around
** [sqlite3_exec()].  The sqlite3_get_table() routine does not have access
** to any internal data structures of SQLite.  It uses only the public
** interface defined here.  As a consequence, errors that occur in the
** wrapper layer outside of the internal [sqlite3_exec()] call are not
** reflected in subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] or

** CAPI3REF: Compile-Time Authorization Callbacks
** METHOD: sqlite3
** KEYWORDS: {authorizer callback}
**
** ^This routine registers an authorizer callback with a particular
** [database connection], supplied in the first argument.
** ^The authorizer callback is invoked as SQL statements are being compiled
** by [sqlite3_prepare()] or its variants [sqlite3_prepare_v2()],
** [sqlite3_prepare_v3()], [sqlite3_prepare16()], [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()],
** and [sqlite3_prepare16_v3()].  ^At various
** points during the compilation process, as logic is being created
** to perform various actions, the authorizer callback is invoked to
** see if those actions are allowed.  ^The authorizer callback should
** return [SQLITE_OK] to allow the action, [SQLITE_IGNORE] to disallow the
** specific action but allow the SQL statement to continue to be
** compiled, or [SQLITE_DENY] to cause the entire SQL statement to be
** rejected with an error.  ^If the authorizer callback returns
** any value other than [SQLITE_IGNORE], [SQLITE_OK], or [SQLITE_DENY]
** then the [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered
** the authorizer will fail with an error message.
**
** When the callback returns [SQLITE_OK], that means the operation
** requested is ok.  ^When the callback returns [SQLITE_DENY], the
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered the
** authorizer will fail with an error message explaining that
** access is denied.
**
** ^The first parameter to the authorizer callback is a copy of the third
** parameter to the sqlite3_set_authorizer() interface. ^The second parameter
** to the callback is an integer [SQLITE_COPY | action code] that specifies
** the particular action to be authorized. ^The third through sixth parameters
** to the callback are either NULL pointers or zero-terminated strings
** that contain additional details about the action to be authorized.
** Applications must always be prepared to encounter a NULL pointer in any
** of the third through the sixth parameters of the authorization callback.
**
** ^If the action code is [SQLITE_READ]
** and the callback returns [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the
** [prepared statement] statement is constructed to substitute
** a NULL value in place of the table column that would have
** been read if [SQLITE_OK] had been returned.  The [SQLITE_IGNORE]
** return can be used to deny an untrusted user access to individual
** columns of a table.
** ^When a table is referenced by a [SELECT] but no column values are
** extracted from that table (for example in a query like
** "SELECT count(*) FROM tab") then the [SQLITE_READ] authorizer callback
** is invoked once for that table with a column name that is an empty string.
** ^If the action code is [SQLITE_DELETE] and the callback returns
** [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the [DELETE] operation proceeds but the
** [truncate optimization] is disabled and all rows are deleted individually.
**
** An authorizer is used when [sqlite3_prepare | preparing]
** SQL statements from an untrusted source, to ensure that the SQL statements
** do not try to access data they are not allowed to see, or that they do not
** try to execute malicious statements that damage the database.  For
** example, an application may allow a user to enter arbitrary
** SQL queries for evaluation by a database.  But the application does
** not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the
** database.  An authorizer could then be put in place while the
** user-entered SQL is being [sqlite3_prepare | prepared] that
** disallows everything except [SELECT] statements.
**
** Applications that need to process SQL from untrusted sources
** might also consider lowering resource limits using [sqlite3_limit()]
** and limiting database size using the [max_page_count] [PRAGMA]
** in addition to using an authorizer.
**
** ^(Only a single authorizer can be in place on a database connection
** at a time.  Each call to sqlite3_set_authorizer overrides the
** previous call.)^  ^Disable the authorizer by installing a NULL callback.
** The authorizer is disabled by default.
**
** The authorizer callback must not do anything that will modify
** the database connection that invoked the authorizer callback.
** Note that [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite3_step()] both modify their
** database connections for the meaning of "modify" in this paragraph.
**
** ^When [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] is used to prepare a statement, the
** statement might be re-prepared during [sqlite3_step()] due to a
** schema change.  Hence, the application should ensure that the
** correct authorizer callback remains in place during the [sqlite3_step()].
**
** ^Note that the authorizer callback is invoked only during
** [sqlite3_prepare()] or its variants.  Authorization is not
** performed during statement evaluation in [sqlite3_step()], unless
** as stated in the previous paragraph, sqlite3_step() invokes
** sqlite3_prepare_v2() to reprepare a statement after a schema change.

** "localhost". ^If the authority is not an empty string or "localhost", an
** error is returned to the caller. ^The fragment component of a URI, if
** present, is ignored.
**
** ^SQLite uses the path component of the URI as the name of the disk file
** which contains the database. ^If the path begins with a '/' character,
** then it is interpreted as an absolute path. ^If the path does not begin
** with a '/' (meaning that the authority section is omitted from the URI)
** then the path is interpreted as a relative path.
** ^(On windows, the first component of an absolute path
** is a drive specification (e.g. "C:").)^
**
** [[core URI query parameters]]
** The query component of a URI may contain parameters that are interpreted
** either by SQLite itself, or by a [VFS | custom VFS implementation].
** SQLite and its built-in [VFSes] interpret the
** following query parameters:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> <b>vfs</b>: ^The "vfs" parameter may be used to specify the name of
**     a VFS object that provides the operating system interface that should
**     be used to access the database file on disk. ^If this option is set to
**     an empty string the default VFS object is used. ^Specifying an unknown
**     VFS is an error. ^If sqlite3_open_v2() is used and the vfs option is
**     present, then the VFS specified by the option takes precedence over
**     the value passed as the fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2().
**
**   <li> <b>mode</b>: ^(The mode parameter may be set to either "ro", "rw",
**     "rwc", or "memory". Attempting to set it to any other value is
**     an error)^.
**     ^If "ro" is specified, then the database is opened for read-only
**     access, just as if the [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY] flag had been set in the
**     third argument to sqlite3_open_v2(). ^If the mode option is set to
**     "rw", then the database is opened for read-write (but not create)
**     access, as if SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE (but not SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE) had
**     been set. ^Value "rwc" is equivalent to setting both
**     SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE and SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE.  ^If the mode option is
**     set to "memory" then a pure [in-memory database] that never reads
**     or writes from disk is used. ^It is an error to specify a value for
**     the mode parameter that is less restrictive than that specified by
**     the flags passed in the third parameter to sqlite3_open_v2().
**
**   <li> <b>cache</b>: ^The cache parameter may be set to either "shared" or
**     "private". ^Setting it to "shared" is equivalent to setting the
**     SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE bit in the flags argument passed to
**     sqlite3_open_v2(). ^Setting the cache parameter to "private" is
**     equivalent to setting the SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE bit.
**     ^If sqlite3_open_v2() is used and the "cache" parameter is present in
**     a URI filename, its value overrides any behavior requested by setting
**     SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE or SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE flag.
**
**  <li> <b>psow</b>: ^The psow parameter indicates whether or not the
**     [powersafe overwrite] property does or does not apply to the
**     storage media on which the database file resides.
**
**  <li> <b>nolock</b>: ^The nolock parameter is a boolean query parameter
**     which if set disables file locking in rollback journal modes.  This
**     is useful for accessing a database on a filesystem that does not
**     support locking.  Caution:  Database corruption might result if two
**     or more processes write to the same database and any one of those
**     processes uses nolock=1.
**
**  <li> <b>immutable</b>: ^The immutable parameter is a boolean query
**     parameter that indicates that the database file is stored on
**     read-only media.  ^When immutable is set, SQLite assumes that the
**     database file cannot be changed, even by a process with higher
**     privilege, and so the database is opened read-only and all locking
**     and change detection is disabled.  Caution: Setting the immutable
**     property on a database file that does in fact change can result
**     in incorrect query results and/or [SQLITE_CORRUPT] errors.
**     See also: [SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE].
**
** </ul>
**
** ^Specifying an unknown parameter in the query component of a URI is not an
** error.  Future versions of SQLite might understand additional query
** parameters.  See "[query parameters with special meaning to SQLite]" for
** additional information.

**
** <b>Note to Windows users:</b>  The encoding used for the filename argument

** CAPI3REF: Obtain Values For URI Parameters
**
** These are utility routines, useful to [VFS|custom VFS implementations],
** that check if a database file was a URI that contained a specific query
** parameter, and if so obtains the value of that query parameter.
**
** The first parameter to these interfaces (hereafter referred to
** as F) must be one of:
** <ul>
** <li> A database filename pointer created by the SQLite core and
** passed into the xOpen() method of a VFS implementation, or
** <li> A filename obtained from [sqlite3_db_filename()], or
** <li> A new filename constructed using [sqlite3_create_filename()].
** </ul>
** If the F parameter is not one of the above, then the behavior is
** undefined and probably undesirable.  Older versions of SQLite were
** more tolerant of invalid F parameters than newer versions.
**
** If F is a suitable filename (as described in the previous paragraph)
** and if P is the name of the query parameter, then
** sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns the value of the P
** parameter if it exists or a NULL pointer if P does not appear as a
** query parameter on F.  If P is a query parameter of F and it
** has no explicit value, then sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns
** a pointer to an empty string.
**
** The sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routine assumes that P is a boolean
** parameter and returns true (1) or false (0) according to the value
** of P.  The sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routine returns true (1) if the
** value of query parameter P is one of "yes", "true", or "on" in any
** case or if the value begins with a non-zero number.  The
** sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routines returns false (0) if the value of
** query parameter P is one of "no", "false", or "off" in any case or
** if the value begins with a numeric zero.  If P is not a query
** parameter on F or if the value of P does not match any of the
** above, then sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) returns (B!=0).
**
** The sqlite3_uri_int64(F,P,D) routine converts the value of P into a
** 64-bit signed integer and returns that integer, or D if P does not
** exist.  If the value of P is something other than an integer, then
** zero is returned.
**
** The sqlite3_uri_key(F,N) returns a pointer to the name (not
** the value) of the N-th query parameter for filename F, or a NULL
** pointer if N is less than zero or greater than the number of query
** parameters minus 1.  The N value is zero-based so N should be 0 to obtain
** the name of the first query parameter, 1 for the second parameter, and
** so forth.
**
** If F is a NULL pointer, then sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns NULL and
** sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) returns B.  If F is not a NULL pointer and
** is not a database file pathname pointer that the SQLite core passed
** into the xOpen VFS method, then the behavior of this routine is undefined
** and probably undesirable.
**
** Beginning with SQLite [version 3.31.0] ([dateof:3.31.0]) the input F
** parameter can also be the name of a rollback journal file or WAL file
** in addition to the main database file.  Prior to version 3.31.0, these
** routines would only work if F was the name of the main database file.
** When the F parameter is the name of the rollback journal or WAL file,
** it has access to all the same query parameters as were found on the
** main database file.

** CAPI3REF: Compiling An SQL Statement
** KEYWORDS: {SQL statement compiler}
** METHOD: sqlite3
** CONSTRUCTOR: sqlite3_stmt
**
** To execute an SQL statement, it must first be compiled into a byte-code
** program using one of these routines.  Or, in other words, these routines
** are constructors for the [prepared statement] object.
**
** The preferred routine to use is [sqlite3_prepare_v2()].  The
** [sqlite3_prepare()] interface is legacy and should be avoided.
** [sqlite3_prepare_v3()] has an extra "prepFlags" option that is used
** for special purposes.
**
** The use of the UTF-8 interfaces is preferred, as SQLite currently
** does all parsing using UTF-8.  The UTF-16 interfaces are provided
** as a convenience.  The UTF-16 interfaces work by converting the
** input text into UTF-8, then invoking the corresponding UTF-8 interface.
**
** The first argument, "db", is a [database connection] obtained from a
** prior successful call to [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open_v2()] or
** [sqlite3_open16()].  The database connection must not have been closed.
**
** The second argument, "zSql", is the statement to be compiled, encoded
** as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite3_prepare(), sqlite3_prepare_v2(),
** and sqlite3_prepare_v3()
** interfaces use UTF-8, and sqlite3_prepare16(), sqlite3_prepare16_v2(),
** and sqlite3_prepare16_v3() use UTF-16.
**
** ^If the nByte argument is negative, then zSql is read up to the
** first zero terminator. ^If nByte is positive, then it is the
** number of bytes read from zSql.  ^If nByte is zero, then no prepared
** statement is generated.
** If the caller knows that the supplied string is nul-terminated, then
** there is a small performance advantage to passing an nByte parameter that
** is the number of bytes in the input string <i>including</i>
** the nul-terminator.
**
** ^If pzTail is not NULL then *pzTail is made to point to the first byte
** past the end of the first SQL statement in zSql.  These routines only
** compile the first statement in zSql, so *pzTail is left pointing to
** what remains uncompiled.
**
** ^*ppStmt is left pointing to a compiled [prepared statement] that can be
** executed using [sqlite3_step()].  ^If there is an error, *ppStmt is set
** to NULL.  ^If the input text contains no SQL (if the input is an empty
** string or a comment) then *ppStmt is set to NULL.
** The calling procedure is responsible for deleting the compiled
** SQL statement using [sqlite3_finalize()] after it has finished with it.
** ppStmt may not be NULL.
**
** ^On success, the sqlite3_prepare() family of routines return [SQLITE_OK];
** otherwise an [error code] is returned.
**
** The sqlite3_prepare_v2(), sqlite3_prepare_v3(), sqlite3_prepare16_v2(),
** and sqlite3_prepare16_v3() interfaces are recommended for all new programs.
** The older interfaces (sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare16())
** are retained for backwards compatibility, but their use is discouraged.
** ^In the "vX" interfaces, the prepared statement
** that is returned (the [sqlite3_stmt] object) contains a copy of the
** original SQL text. This causes the [sqlite3_step()] interface to
** behave differently in three ways:
**
** <ol>
** <li>
** ^If the database schema changes, instead of returning [SQLITE_SCHEMA] as it
** always used to do, [sqlite3_step()] will automatically recompile the SQL
** statement and try to run it again. As many as [SQLITE_MAX_SCHEMA_RETRY]
** retries will occur before sqlite3_step() gives up and returns an error.
** </li>
**
** <li>
** ^When an error occurs, [sqlite3_step()] will return one of the detailed
** [error codes] or [extended error codes].  ^The legacy behavior was that
** [sqlite3_step()] would only return a generic [SQLITE_ERROR] result code
** and the application would have to make a second call to [sqlite3_reset()]
** in order to find the underlying cause of the problem. With the "v2" prepare
** interfaces, the underlying reason for the error is returned immediately.
** </li>
**
** <li>
** ^If the specific value bound to a [parameter | host parameter] in the
** WHERE clause might influence the choice of query plan for a statement,
** then the statement will be automatically recompiled, as if there had been
** a schema change, on the first [sqlite3_step()] call following any change
** to the [sqlite3_bind_text | bindings] of that [parameter].
** ^The specific value of a WHERE-clause [parameter] might influence the
** choice of query plan if the parameter is the left-hand side of a [LIKE]
** or [GLOB] operator or if the parameter is compared to an indexed column
** and the [SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4] compile-time option is enabled.
** </li>
** </ol>
**
** <p>^sqlite3_prepare_v3() differs from sqlite3_prepare_v2() only in having
** the extra prepFlags parameter, which is a bit array consisting of zero or
** more of the [SQLITE_PREPARE_PERSISTENT|SQLITE_PREPARE_*] flags.  ^The
** sqlite3_prepare_v2() interface works exactly the same as
** sqlite3_prepare_v3() with a zero prepFlags parameter.

** interfaces [sqlite3_prepare()] or [sqlite3_prepare16()], this function
** must be called one or more times to evaluate the statement.
**
** The details of the behavior of the sqlite3_step() interface depend
** on whether the statement was prepared using the newer "vX" interfaces
** [sqlite3_prepare_v3()], [sqlite3_prepare_v2()], [sqlite3_prepare16_v3()],
** [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] or the older legacy
** interfaces [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()].  The use of the
** new "vX" interface is recommended for new applications but the legacy
** interface will continue to be supported.
**
** ^In the legacy interface, the return value will be either [SQLITE_BUSY],
** [SQLITE_DONE], [SQLITE_ROW], [SQLITE_ERROR], or [SQLITE_MISUSE].
** ^With the "v2" interface, any of the other [result codes] or
** [extended result codes] might be returned as well.
**
** ^[SQLITE_BUSY] means that the database engine was unable to acquire the
** database locks it needs to do its job.  ^If the statement is a [COMMIT]
** or occurs outside of an explicit transaction, then you can retry the
** statement.  If the statement is not a [COMMIT] and occurs within an
** explicit transaction then you should rollback the transaction before
** continuing.
**
** ^[SQLITE_DONE] means that the statement has finished executing
** successfully.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on this virtual
** machine without first calling [sqlite3_reset()] to reset the virtual
** machine back to its initial state.
**
** ^If the SQL statement being executed returns any data, then [SQLITE_ROW]
** is returned each time a new row of data is ready for processing by the
** caller. The values may be accessed using the [column access functions].
** sqlite3_step() is called again to retrieve the next row of data.
**
** ^[SQLITE_ERROR] means that a run-time error (such as a constraint
** violation) has occurred.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on
** the VM. More information may be found by calling [sqlite3_errmsg()].
** ^With the legacy interface, a more specific error code (for example,
** [SQLITE_INTERRUPT], [SQLITE_SCHEMA], [SQLITE_CORRUPT], and so forth)
** can be obtained by calling [sqlite3_reset()] on the
** [prepared statement].  ^In the "v2" interface,
** the more specific error code is returned directly by sqlite3_step().
**
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] means that the this routine was called inappropriately.
** Perhaps it was called on a [prepared statement] that has
** already been [sqlite3_finalize | finalized] or on one that had
** previously returned [SQLITE_ERROR] or [SQLITE_DONE].  Or it could
** be the case that the same database connection is being used by two or
** more threads at the same moment in time.
**
** For all versions of SQLite up to and including 3.6.23.1, a call to
** [sqlite3_reset()] was required after sqlite3_step() returned anything
** other than [SQLITE_ROW] before any subsequent invocation of
** sqlite3_step().  Failure to reset the prepared statement using
** [sqlite3_reset()] would result in an [SQLITE_MISUSE] return from
** sqlite3_step().  But after [version 3.6.23.1] ([dateof:3.6.23.1],
** sqlite3_step() began
** calling [sqlite3_reset()] automatically in this circumstance rather
** than returning [SQLITE_MISUSE].  This is not considered a compatibility
** break because any application that ever receives an SQLITE_MISUSE error
** is broken by definition.  The [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTORESET] compile-time option
** can be used to restore the legacy behavior.
**
** <b>Goofy Interface Alert:</b> In the legacy interface, the sqlite3_step()
** API always returns a generic error code, [SQLITE_ERROR], following any
** error other than [SQLITE_BUSY] and [SQLITE_MISUSE].  You must call
** [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()] in order to find one of the
** specific [error codes] that better describes the error.
** We admit that this is a goofy design.  The problem has been fixed
** with the "v2" interface.  If you prepare all of your SQL statements
** using [sqlite3_prepare_v3()] or [sqlite3_prepare_v2()]
** or [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] or [sqlite3_prepare16_v3()] instead
** of the legacy [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()] interfaces,

**
** <b>Details:</b>
**
** ^These routines return information about a single column of the current
** result row of a query.  ^In every case the first argument is a pointer
** to the [prepared statement] that is being evaluated (the [sqlite3_stmt*]
** that was returned from [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or one of its variants)
** and the second argument is the index of the column for which information
** should be returned. ^The leftmost column of the result set has the index 0.
** ^The number of columns in the result can be determined using
** [sqlite3_column_count()].
**
** If the SQL statement does not currently point to a valid row, or if the
** column index is out of range, the result is undefined.
** These routines may only be called when the most recent call to
** [sqlite3_step()] has returned [SQLITE_ROW] and neither
** [sqlite3_reset()] nor [sqlite3_finalize()] have been called subsequently.
** If any of these routines are called after [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] or after [sqlite3_step()] has returned
** something other than [SQLITE_ROW], the results are undefined.
** If [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()]
** are called from a different thread while any of these routines
** are pending, then the results are undefined.
**
** The first six interfaces (_blob, _double, _int, _int64, _text, and _text16)
** each return the value of a result column in a specific data format.  If
** the result column is not initially in the requested format (for example,
** if the query returns an integer but the sqlite3_column_text() interface
** is used to extract the value) then an automatic type conversion is performed.
**
** ^The sqlite3_column_type() routine returns the
** [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype code] for the initial data type
** of the result column.  ^The returned value is one of [SQLITE_INTEGER],
** [SQLITE_FLOAT], [SQLITE_TEXT], [SQLITE_BLOB], or [SQLITE_NULL].
** The return value of sqlite3_column_type() can be used to decide which
** of the first six interface should be used to extract the column value.
** The value returned by sqlite3_column_type() is only meaningful if no
** automatic type conversions have occurred for the value in question.
** After a type conversion, the result of calling sqlite3_column_type()
** is undefined, though harmless.  Future
** versions of SQLite may change the behavior of sqlite3_column_type()
** following a type conversion.
**
** If the result is a BLOB or a TEXT string, then the sqlite3_column_bytes()
** or sqlite3_column_bytes16() interfaces can be used to determine the size
** of that BLOB or string.
**
** ^If the result is a BLOB or UTF-8 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes()
** routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
** ^If the result is a UTF-16 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes() converts
** the string to UTF-8 and then returns the number of bytes.
** ^If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes() uses
** [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-8 string and returns
** the number of bytes in that string.
** ^If the result is NULL, then sqlite3_column_bytes() returns zero.
**
** ^If the result is a BLOB or UTF-16 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes16()
** routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
** ^If the result is a UTF-8 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes16() converts
** the string to UTF-16 and then returns the number of bytes.
** ^If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes16() uses
** [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-16 string and returns
** the number of bytes in that string.
** ^If the result is NULL, then sqlite3_column_bytes16() returns zero.
**
** ^The values returned by [sqlite3_column_bytes()] and
** [sqlite3_column_bytes16()] do not include the zero terminators at the end
** of the string.  ^For clarity: the values returned by
** [sqlite3_column_bytes()] and [sqlite3_column_bytes16()] are the number of
** bytes in the string, not the number of characters.
**
** ^Strings returned by sqlite3_column_text() and sqlite3_column_text16(),
** even empty strings, are always zero-terminated.  ^The return
** value from sqlite3_column_blob() for a zero-length BLOB is a NULL pointer.
**
** ^Strings returned by sqlite3_column_text16() always have the endianness
** which is native to the platform, regardless of the text encoding set
** for the database.
**
** <b>Warning:</b> ^The object returned by [sqlite3_column_value()] is an
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object.  In a multithreaded environment,
** an unprotected sqlite3_value object may only be used safely with
** [sqlite3_bind_value()] and [sqlite3_result_value()].
** If the [unprotected sqlite3_value] object returned by
** [sqlite3_column_value()] is used in any other way, including calls
** to routines like [sqlite3_value_int()], [sqlite3_value_text()],
** or [sqlite3_value_bytes()], the behavior is not threadsafe.
** Hence, the sqlite3_column_value() interface
** is normally only useful within the implementation of
** [application-defined SQL functions] or [virtual tables], not within
** top-level application code.
**
** These routines may attempt to convert the datatype of the result.
** ^For example, if the internal representation is FLOAT and a text result
** is requested, [sqlite3_snprintf()] is used internally to perform the
** conversion automatically.  ^(The following table details the conversions
** that are applied:
**
** <blockquote>
** <table border="1">
** <tr><th> Internal<br>Type <th> Requested<br>Type <th>  Conversion
**
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td> INTEGER   <td> Result is 0
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Result is 0.0
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   TEXT    <td> Result is a NULL pointer
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   BLOB    <td> Result is a NULL pointer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>  FLOAT    <td> Convert from integer to float
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the integer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   BLOB    <td> Same as INTEGER->TEXT
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td> INTEGER   <td> [CAST] to INTEGER
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the float
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td>   BLOB    <td> [CAST] to BLOB

** </blockquote>)^
**
** Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior
** calls to sqlite3_column_blob(), sqlite3_column_text(), and/or
** sqlite3_column_text16() may be invalidated.
** Type conversions and pointer invalidations might occur
** in the following cases:
**
** <ul>
** <li> The initial content is a BLOB and sqlite3_column_text() or
**      sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  A zero-terminator might
**      need to be added to the string.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-8 text and sqlite3_column_bytes16() or
**      sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-16.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-16 text and sqlite3_column_bytes() or
**      sqlite3_column_text() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-8.</li>
** </ul>
**
** ^Conversions between UTF-16be and UTF-16le are always done in place and do
** not invalidate a prior pointer, though of course the content of the buffer
** that the prior pointer references will have been modified.  Other kinds
** of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometimes they
** are not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.
**
** The safest policy is to invoke these routines
** in one of the following ways:
**
** <ul>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_blob() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>

**
** In other words, you should call sqlite3_column_text(),
** sqlite3_column_blob(), or sqlite3_column_text16() first to force the result
** into the desired format, then invoke sqlite3_column_bytes() or
** sqlite3_column_bytes16() to find the size of the result.  Do not mix calls
** to sqlite3_co
